The application is a website's homepage called "Horiseon." it's purpose is for user to navigate thorught the page and be able to find information and about company.

What I did to complete the task of cleaning up the code was I seperated the code into different sections to differentiate what it's affecting. Then I relaibled the Title to "Horiseon". I Changed one of the many "div's" to a "Header." In header I changed div into "nav" and changed alled "header div" css selectors to "header nav" so they are linked. I changed a bigger portion to "main" and in the "main" portion I seperated the code into smaller sections I relabled them "section." I added 'alt="exemple"' to all the jpg img sources. I verified the code with https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input.

It's layout / desgined is ment to easly let the user navigate the hompage by clicking the header tabs and be directly brought to that information article.
